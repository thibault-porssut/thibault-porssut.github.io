I"È<div style="text-align: justify;"> I worked for <a href="https://www.mechdyne.com/" target="_blank">Mechdyne</a> at the <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/" target="_blank">EVL</a> laboratory in Chicago. I worked several projects. My first project was to work for L'Or√©al. I implemented a VR application in the <a href="https://www.mechdyne.com/hardware.aspx?name=CAVE2" target="_blank">CAVE2</a>. It was a Unity project simulating a virtual shop where the user were able to grab virtual L'Or√©al products. I tested several interactions and different ways to have a virtual shopping cart coupled with a smartphone. My second project was to evaluate asymmetrical collaboration between a user in the CAVE2 and a user with an HMD (HTC Vive). </div>
