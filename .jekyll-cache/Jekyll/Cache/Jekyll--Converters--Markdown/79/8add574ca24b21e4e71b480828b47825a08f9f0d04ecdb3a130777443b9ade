I"Á<div style="text-align: justify;"> I worked for <a href="https://www.mechdyne.com/" target="_blank">Mechdyne</a> at the <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/" target="_blank">EVL</a> laboratory in Chicago. I worked several projects. My first project was to work for Or√©al. I have implemented a VR application in the <a href="https://www.mechdyne.com/hardware.aspx?name=CAVE2" target="_blank">CAVE2</a>. It was a Unity project simulating a virtual shop where the user were able to grab virtual Or√©al product. We have tested several interactions and different way to have an inventory ( smartphone and virtual bag). My second project was to evaluate asymmetric collaboration beween an user in the CAVE2 and an user with an HMD ( HTC Vive). </div>
