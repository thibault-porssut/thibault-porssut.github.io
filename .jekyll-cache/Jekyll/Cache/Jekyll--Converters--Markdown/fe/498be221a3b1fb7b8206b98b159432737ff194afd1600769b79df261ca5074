I"Y<div style="text-align: justify !important;"> I received a Master's degree in Mechanical engineering and Industrial Engineering from Ecole des Arts et Métiers and a Research Master’s degree in Digital Mock-up and Virtual Immersion from Institut Image in France. I did my Master project at EVL in Chicago in partnership with Mechdyne.  It was about collaborative tasks between the HTC Vive and the CAVE2.  Now I work on “Embodiment in Virtual Reality” as a PhD student at EPFL under the supervision of Dr. Ronan Boulic and Dr. Buno Herbelin for the IIG laboratory and the LNCO laboratory.</div>
