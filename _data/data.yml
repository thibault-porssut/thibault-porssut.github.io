    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      <div style= "text-align: justify !important;"> Since I was a child, I have had a passion for Virtual Reality (VR). It all started when watching The Lawnmower Man and The Matrix. Then, the Oculus DK1 was released, and I decided that I would work in VR. Since then I have worked with XR technologies (VR, MR and AR), first during my master and then during my PhD. I’ve explored many facets of XR and related fields, including telecollaboration, interactions, animation, human behaviour, brain computer interfaces, and machine learning. The diversity of XR work makes me believe in its limitless potential. My main interest is using biofeedback and AI to implicitly personalize the users’ experience. With this approach, I dream of, one day, removing the boundary between Virtual and Reality.</div>
