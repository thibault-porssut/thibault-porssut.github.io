    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      <div style= "text-align: justify !important;"> I received a Master's degree in Mechanical engineering and Industrial Engineering from Ecole des Arts et Métiers and a Research Master’s degree in Digital Mock-up and Virtual Immersion from Institut Image in France. I did my Master project at EVL in Chicago in partnership with Mechdyne.  It was about collaborative tasks between the HTC Vive and the CAVE2.  Now I work on “Embodiment in Virtual Reality” as a PhD student at EPFL under the supervision of Dr. Ronan Boulic and Dr. Bruno Herbelin for the IIG laboratory and the LNCO laboratory.</div>

        <div style="text-align: justify;"> I'm a teaching assistant for the C and C++ programming courses for 1st year bachelor students and a VR course for master students.
        I have supervised several semester projects for both  master and bachelor students. A list of these projects is available under the Supervised Project section.</div>

    - role: Internship
      time: March 2016 - August 2016
      company: Electronic Visualization Laboratory, Chicago/Mechdyne, Marshalltown
      details: |
        <div style="text-align: justify;"> I worked for <a href="https://www.mechdyne.com/" target="_blank">Mechdyne</a> at the <a href="https://www.evl.uic.edu/" target="_blank">EVL</a> laboratory in Chicago. For my first project, I implemented a VR application designed for <a href="https://www.mechdyne.com/hardware.aspx?name=CAVE2">CAVE2</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://www.loreal.com/" target="_blank">L'Oréal</a>. It was a Unity project simulating a virtual shop where the user were able to grab virtual L'Oréal products. I tested several interactions and different ways to have a virtual shopping cart coupled with a smartphone. My second project was to evaluate asymmetrical collaboration between a user in the CAVE2 and a user with an HMD (HTC Vive). </div>

       <div style="text-align: justify;"> Implemented an immersive application for the businesses working around Châlon-sur-Saône. A long with a second student, I have implemented a Unity application showcasing a modular shipping container. This container can have several different purposes, for example a laboratory, and the user was able to arrange the 3D model in realtime with several components available. </div>
        
    - role: Student Project
      time: September 2016 - December 2016
      company: Institut Image, Châlon-sur-Saône
